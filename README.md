# Emoji Searcher

A library to help with all your emoji searching needs. This library uses [Emojibase](https://github.com/milesj/emojibase) data to search shortcodes and tags and link them back to an emoji.

The library provides management utilities for saving/restoring/retrieving the newest version of the emojibase data as well as an embedded copy of the data if the program author does not want to deal with updating.

Developed mainly for use in my own projects but should be general enough that others could use if they have a need. For example usage see examples/search_emojis.rs or https://github.com/sphaerophoria/ibus-memebox
